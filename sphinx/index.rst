Hello!
-----

My name is Joseph Jennings. I am really interested in using sphinx for a website. 
While it is designed to be used for python documentation, I think it will work very nicely for
a "notebook" if you will, on which I can post explanations of the code I commit to my 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/ke0m/>`_

I plan to post the following things on my website:

1. Post figures, mathematics and other explanations associated with the code on my GitHub 
   repository. Some of the projects I would like to post are:
      * Structure-oriented smoothing of 2D images on the GPU
      * The solved problems from my coursera course
